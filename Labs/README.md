## Day 3 – Assessment

### Task
Create an **Azure Storage Account** with **LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)** redundancy.  
Then complete the following:

- Create a **Blob Storage** service
- Create a **Blob container**
- Upload a **text file** to the container

# Challenge – Azure Storage Account

## Objective
Create and use an **Azure Storage Account** to understand the core storage services:
**Blob, File Share, Queue, and Table**.

---

## Scenario
You are working on an online learning platform that requires different types of storage for content, documents, messages, and metadata.

Your task is to design and implement this using an **Azure Storage Account**.

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create a Storage Account
- Create an **Azure Storage Account**
- Configuration:
  - Performance: **Standard**
  - Redundancy: **LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)**
- Note the following:
  - Storage account name
  - Region
  - Replication type

---

### Task 2: Blob Storage
- Create a **Blob container** named:  
  `training-content`
- Upload:
  - One video or large file
  - One PDF or text file
- Set the container access level to **Private**

---

### Task 3: File Share
- Create an **Azure File Share** named:  
  `team-docs`
- Upload any document (txt, pdf, or docx)

---

### Task 4: Queue Storage
- Create a **Queue** named:  
  `user-registration`
- Add at least **3 messages**
- View and delete one message

---

### Task 5: Table Storage
- Create a **Table** named:  
  `students`
- Add at least **3 entities** with the following fields:
  - PartitionKey
  - RowKey
  - Name
  - Course

---


### Task 6: Blob Soft Delete & Recovery
- Enable **Soft Delete** for Blob Storage
- Delete one blob from the `training-content` container
- Restore the deleted blob

---

### Task 7: Access Control using SAS
- Generate a **Shared Access Signature (SAS)** for one blob
- Configure it as **read-only**
- Verify that the file can be accessed using the SAS URL

### Task 8: Blob Storage Access Tiers
- Change the access tier of one blob from **Hot** to **Cool**
- Observe the available access tier options
- Note when each tier should be used (Hot vs Cool vs Archive)
